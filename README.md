This is an implementation of the Legendre Memory Unit using C++.

The Legendre Memory Unit is a novel Recurrent Neural Network design capable of achieving very fast speeds using few resources. It utilizes a sliding window of time, onto which the continuous time history of the network is orthogonally mapped. 

**This project is currently unfinished and does not function.**

## Make 

This program can be built using **make**. 

Make targets:
* **lmu**  -            Compiles LMU code
* **client** -          Compile a standalone client with a terminal interface
* **embedded** -        Compile with wrappers for JavaScript, for use in larger applications 
* **tests** -           Compile and run tests 
* **clean**  -          Removes all generated files

## Dependencies
Armadillo - a linear algebra and scientific computing library. Version 11.2.3
